# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A personal reading tracker application designed to replace Goodreads with a clean, focused interface for tracking reading progress through an optimized reading list. The application will be hosted in Docker on a Raspberry Pi and accessed via Tailscale, providing a private, self-hosted solution. The app will serve as a comprehensive reading companion, integrating progress tracking with Kindle highlights and quotes management for each book.
